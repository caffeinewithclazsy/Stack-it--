- **Answers**: Responses to questions with acceptance status
- **Tags**: Categorization system for questions
- **Votes**: User voting on questions and answers
- **Notifications**: Real-time user notifications
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration for secure user authentication
- OpenID Connect protocol implementation
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Middleware for protecting authenticated routes

### Content Management
- Rich text editor using TipTap for creating questions and answers
- Tag system for categorizing content
- Vote system for community-driven content quality
- Answer acceptance mechanism for question resolution

### User Interface
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom cream and orange color scheme
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- Loading states and error handling throughout the application

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Notification system for user engagement
- Real-time vote counting and content updates

### Personalization Features

## Data Flow

### Question Creation Flow
1. User navigates to /ask page (authentication required)
2. Form submission with title, content, and tags
3. Server validates input and creates question record
4. Database stores question with associated tags
5. User redirected to question detail page

### Voting System Flow
1. User clicks vote buttons on questions/answers
2. Client sends vote request with authentication
3. Server validates user permissions and updates vote counts
4. Database updates vote records and content scores
5. UI updates reflect new vote totals in real-time

### Notification Flow
1. Actions trigger notification creation (new answers, votes, etc.)
2. Server creates notification records in database
3. WebSocket pushes real-time updates to affected users
4. Client displays notification badges and dropdown

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite development server with hot module replacement
- TypeScript compilation with strict type checking
- Replit-specific development tooling integration

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized client bundle to `dist/public`
- ESBuild compiles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static assets served from Express server
- Environment variables for database and authentication configuration

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema versioning
- Push-based deployment with `db:push` command
- Connection pooling with Neon serverless database

### Authentication Configuration
- Replit Auth integration with environment variables
- OIDC configuration with automatic discovery
- Session security with HTTP-only cookies and CSRF protection

The application is designed as a production-ready prototype that demonstrates clear value proposition through its clean interface, robust feature set, and scalable architecture suitable for community-driven Q&A platforms.
